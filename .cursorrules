# Trainy Project Rules

## Stack
React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Supabase

## Code Style
- Functional components with hooks only
- async/await, never .then()
- Named exports preferred
- Console.log all API calls (debugging phase)
- Keep components < 200 lines
- Descriptive variable names

## File Patterns
- Services: src/services/{provider}Api.ts
- Types: src/types/{domain}.ts
- Pages: src/pages/{Name}Page.tsx
- Components: src/components/{Name}.tsx
- Utils: src/utils/{name}.ts

## API Type Prefixes
- NS* for Dutch rail data
- DB* for German rail data
- SNCF* for French rail data
- Merged* for combined cross-border data
- *Raw suffix for untransformed API responses

## API Integration
- Always log requests and responses
- Handle errors with try/catch
- Type all API responses
- Comment on quirks and edge cases
- Use VITE_ prefix for env vars

## Cross-Border Logic
- Match trains by number + departure time (±5 min)
- NS authoritative for Dutch stations
- DB authoritative for German stations
- SNCF authoritative for French stations

## Avoid
- Over-engineering (validation project)
- Premature optimization
- Single-use abstractions
- Features beyond current phase scope

## Current Phase
Phase 1: NS API integration + basic search
